I. DESCRIPTION
--------------
This repository contains the scripts and data files relating to Section V of the paper "Economies of Scope for Electricity Storage and Variable Renewables" by Gonçalo Terça and David Wozabal.

COPYRIGHT: Gonçalo Terça and David Wozabal, 05/2020.

II. REQUIREMENTS
----------------
The case studies are coded in MATLAB and require a basic MATLAB installation and optimization toolbox (alternatively any other linear programming solver that interfaces with YALMIP), and the YALMIP package to freely available at
https://yalmip.github.io/download/
The installation directory of YALMIP has to be added to the MATLAB path.

III. CONTENTS
-------------
TOP LEVEL: generate_table_II.m generates Table II from the paper and calculates results for both case studies.

CASE STUDY 1: The first case study considers an upper bound for the profits generated by optimal bidding of an electricity storage on the German spot market for electricity as described in Section 5 of the paper (see file ub_spot_bidding.m). 

CASE STUDY 2: The second case study considers a suboptimal non-anticipative strategy of operating an electricity  storage on the German secondary control reserve market as described in section 5 of the paper (see lb_secondary_control_reserve.m).
